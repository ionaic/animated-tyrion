The suggested repo name was too good.  This is a project inspired by "sound ripples" that you see as an effect with characters like Toph (Avatar: the Last Airbender) and Daredevil (Marvel Comics) where sound is visualized as ripples which describe a dark space.  Goal is to produce a Toph ripple shader. Uses OpenFrameworks and OpenGL/GLSL.

The test audio I have been using is "Settle Down" by Kimbra.
